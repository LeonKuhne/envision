## what
predict next frames using previous frames

## why
train on particle simulations and zooms out to predict higher order systems

## how
#### learn (ai)
- all data has same resolution
- x,y resolution is same and fixed
#### evolve (genetics) "survival of the fitest"
- a fixed population of ai compete in rounds
- each ai has an independent neural net
- successfull ai replace unsuccessfull ones each round
- unsuccessfull ai are more likely to mutate their neural configuration
#### think (society)
- continuing to learn while predicting
- use computed average results as expected
